LCC Issue Tracker - README
LCC Issue Tracker is a Python Flask-based issue tracking management system designed and developed for Lincoln Community Campground (LCC). It aims to help visitors efficiently report campsite issues and allow volunteers (Helpers) and administrators (Admins) to manage and solve these issues conveniently. The system uses the Flask framework as the backend, MySQL database for data storage, and Bootstrap for front-end UI design to ensure a good user experience on mobile phones, tablets and desktops.

The system supports three user roles, namely Visitor, Helper and Admin, and different roles have different access rights. Visitors can register new accounts, log in to the system, submit issues, view and comment on their own reports, and manage personal information (such as email, name, location, avatar, etc.). In addition to having visitor permissions, volunteers can also view all issues, add comments, and modify the status of issues according to the progress of issue processing (such as new, processing, shelved, resolved). Administrators can view and search all user information, manage the statusof user accounts (activate/disable), and adjust user roles (visitor/volunteer/administrator) on the basis of having volunteer permissions.

This system implements a secure user authentication mechanism. All passwords are hashed and stored by Flask-Bcrypt. Flask Session is used for session management to ensure access control for different roles. For ease of testing, the system provides default accounts, including visitors, volunteers, and administrators. Users should change their passwords in time after the first login to improve security.

During the project development process, we followed the best practices of software engineering to ensure clear code structure and rigorous logic, and maintained complete version control records on GitHub. In terms of deployment, this system can be run locally or hosted online through PythonAnywhere.
